<p id="0957bfce-cf6a-4410-8a59-0239b08a0cb9" class="">If you have an active app, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/active-developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Portal</a> to grab your badge! There, you should find a prompt to join the Active Developer Program and claim your badge, by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#70ebf968-173e-4ffb-86d5-2e417eeb20a4" target="_self">SELECT AN ACTIVE APP</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="70ebf968-173e-4ffb-86d5-2e417eeb20a4" class="wysiwyg-indent1">SELECT AN ACTIVE APP</h3>
<p id="7d2c9e6e-0363-4075-9a33-8a48a593e98a" class="wysiwyg-indent1">First, select an app from the dropdown (this is the app that we will check is 'Active'). You will want this to be your most active app, but it can be any app as long as it has received a command within the past 30 days.</p>
<h3 id="h_01GHW11D9TAXKM9YVATV2P63BX" class="wysiwyg-indent1">DESIGNATE A COMMUNITY SERVER</h3>
<p id="77103cd7-19c3-47a6-9ec9-1f9e01ef05d1" class="wysiwyg-indent1">Next, designate your official server for your app (for example, your App Support Server, App Community Server or App Development Server).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">If you don't see any servers in the Support Server list, make sure the one you are looking for is set as a Community Server. Here is more information on how to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server" target="_self">enable the community feature</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01GHW11VRTNAYAMAATV3MEB4VH" class="wysiwyg-indent1">CHOOSE A DEVELOPER NEWS CHANNEL</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Finally, select the channel within the designated server for the Developer News channel to appear in. This will allow for updates about Discord API and Developer News to be sent right to your server's channel.</p>
<p id="eafec787-09b0-425e-bf6a-84805c27f107" class="wysiwyg-indent1">Once these steps are complete, you should see your new Active Developer Badge on your Profile! <strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>

<h2 id="h_01GHHJQAQXHCKHPT7T737K1KJM">WHAT IF I AM ON A DEVELOPER TEAM?</h2>
<p class="">Good news! As long as the team you are on owns an active app, you can obtain the Active Developer Badge by following the steps <a href="#12558cc2-aad8-4894-872a-e0fa0a6d8044" target="_self">above</a>.</p>
<h2>I'M ON A TEAM, BUT CAN'T CLAIM THE BADGE</h2>
<p>If an app is not owned by you, but you're a team member working on the application, you can claim the badge only if it's owned by a Developer Team in the Developer Portal. If the bot is currently owned by an individual, they'll need to transfer it to a Developer Team and invite you to that team in order to claim the badge.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h_01GHMJFS8G42F0WZGJH766H27B">I HAVE AN ACTIVE APP, BUT IT SAYS I AM NOT ELIGIBLE</h2>
<p id="7731b8fd-78e8-4fc3-8e55-ddea485ac930" class="">If you have an active app and feel you should be eligible for the Active Developer Badge, please allow at least 24 hours for your app's activity status to be updated.</p>
<h2>I RAN A COMMAND, BUT IT'S STILL INELIGIBLE</h2>
<p>In order for us to detect command usage, at least one person using the app needs to have "Use data to improve Discord" enabled within User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety. 24 hours needs to pass after we detect a command, so make sure to wait 24 hours after enabling this setting before trying again.</p>
<h2>WHAT KINDS OF COMMANDS QUALIFY?</h2>
<p>Only application commands qualify. This typically refers to slash commands and context menu commands. Legacy prefix-based commands do not count, nor do other kinds of API interactions such as oAuth calls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>I CLAIMED MY BADGE, BUT I DON'T HAVE IT</h2>
<p>If you successfully claimed your Active Developer Badge, but you don't see it on your Profile, try restarting/refreshing your client.</p>
<p class="callout">⚠️ If you are on a mobile device, check back for mobile support of this feature coming in early December! In the meantime you can view your new badge from Web and Desktop clients.</p>
<h2>I CAN'T SELECT A SERVER AS MY OFFICIAL SERVER</h2>
<p>In order for a server to appear in the server selection menu, it needs to be set as a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server" target="_self">Community Server,</a> and you need to have the Administrator permission in the server.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>I AM ELIGIBLE. WHEN WILL I RECEIVE THE BADGE?</h2>
<p>The badge is not distributed automatically. In order to claim the Active Developer Badge, you must visit the <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/" target="_self">Developer Portal</a> to claim it as documented above.</p>
